        Well, well, well. Aren't you a sly one! ðŸ˜‹ Checking out my posts before I've officially launched them!
        <br><br>
        In all seriousness, thanks for your attention, but this post isn't quite ready yet. I will announce on <a href="https://twitter.com/SaberaTalukder?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">twitter</a> when it is!
        <br><br><br><br>


        <!-- -----------------

        When I started this I wanted to see all the talks together, no authors, no schools, just talk titles so that I could put myself into Laura and Tim's (the organizer's) minds and envision what they wanted us to get out of Cosyne 22. So I did that and before you read this blog post I encourage you to go look at the list of titles and think for yourself what trends emerge. And I already coalated a list for you so you don't even have to do much work. Also if you were wondering how the poster session was organized there is a fun fact that is addresed in the companion cosyne post.

        <br><br>
        &emsp; I've spent the last 6 days, live-tweeting cosyne and trying my best to say transmit what you all want to put into the world. So if you're looking for the run down of what happened at cosyne you're in teh wrong place. I will point you to the tweet threads and videos if that is what you're looking for. Instead the more important thing to address is how we tie all of these research threads together to take a pulse not only on where we are, but also where we want to go. Bill Gates is attributed with saying we overestimate what we can achieve in 1 year but underestimate what we can achieve in 5. And this is only true if we take an honest stock of where we are in a field. As a rule of thumb (and I good one I think) I will never put anything negative on twitter, because there is never enough space to truly describe the minutiae of our arguments, but here I'm going to talk about the positive and the negative trends (?) I've observed at the conference.

        Positive / Negative

        &emsp; The opening slide of the conference says it all! Goodbye covid hello to the first in person cosyne in 2 years!

        This blog post isn't going to walk you through what happened day by day at the conference. If that's what you're looking for skip to the end of each section where I'll link to my live-tweet threads walking you through what actually went down.

        What I want to address here are the trends.

        What do I mean by trends?
        -data becoming more openly available
        -more experimental work popping up, not just manifolds (also goes to adams point that there is more diversity of thought at this cosyne when compared to cosynes past)
        -communication (in the between student and PI - DEI lunch)

        Negative
        -

        <br><br>
        <br>
        If the text is blue the link is clickable and will take you to an in depth account of what happend live during each session.
        <br>
        The purpose of these live tweet threads was to capture the reality of what was happening and not comment on it.
        <br>
        You may also find the cosyne recordings and world wide neuro poster abstracts and sessions useful if you want to dive further in depth.
        <br>
        There are 3 levels of invovlement you can now take when trying to understand what happened at cosyne. From least depth to most depth  (1) Look at the session and talk titles below, (2) click on the twitter threads and see highlights from each talk and poster session, (3) watch the recordings and go the poster abstracts on world wide neuro. I want to enable you to choose your own experince.
        <br>
        This blog post fills a gap that does not have to do with directly listing or commenting on the details of what we learned about. It's about synthesizing the trends that transcend model animal, experiment v. computation,... These thoughts are my attempt at synthesizing not only where we currently stand as a field and as a community, where we are hoping to go, and some of the ways in which we might fail to meet our goals.

        ---------
        High Level Thoughts so Far
        FbRL is recruiting hard - this seems to be the trend at the more computational neuro conferences

        Human is Hot - Eric moving into the more human chronic neuropixels work

        Dissapointed:
        - There isn't more female representation  this was commented on on twitter


        Thrilled:
        - 

        ---------
        Day 1:

        Bing Brunton
        Robert Data
        Carsen and Marius 

        Poster Session

        First question of cosyne 2022
        Conversation with Byron Yu

        ---------
        Day 2:

        During the industry session hosted by FB reality labs - David made a comment about how if you want to build the next transformer you don't go to reality labs you go to FAIR. There is a distinction betwen ML and ML for computational neuroscience and I think this is interesting.

        Postdoc didn't like the academia panel, thought that it did a hit job of do academia justice (ON day 3 I talked to a PhD that really enjoyed the talk [pantelis] once that thought it was too simple [george])

        Byron Yu -> There are people well versed in the experiment or the computation but it is really rare to find someone who does both

        What counts as machine learning research in neuro vs ml in ml are very different standards.

        ---------
        Day 3:
