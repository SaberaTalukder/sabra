                   <!--  <p>Hi and welcome! In this blog we will be discussing everything related to neuroengineering. Considering "neuroengineering" is a loaded term, let's upack it a little bit. Neuroengineering to me is anything that pertains to the study of the brain and how it processes information, the hardware and software innovations that attempt to work in tandem with or decipher information about the brain, and possibly most importantly the intersections between these two areas.</p>

                   <p>In this blog we will be addressing three topics that are all crucial to understanding where neuroengineering currently is as a field and where it is going. The first is general knowledge about neuroscience, artificial intelligence, brain machine interfaces, hardware devlopment, and the list goes on. The second topic we will explore are interviews with leading experts in all of the aforementioned fields. The third is steping through interesting neuroengineering papers and analyzing their content, pitfalls, and implications.</p>

                    <p>I am really excited to be on this journey with you! And I hope you are excited to learn something new about neuroengineering every Monday morning!</p> -->

                                        <font face="Garamond" size="5px" style="line-height: 1.6;"> You’ve heard variations of these words in whispers throughout the internet, but you might not actually know what they mean; no one could blame you! This burgeoning, fuzzily defined, interdisciplinary field of neuroscience, electrical engineering, biochemistry, and computer science has barely begun.
                                        <br><br>

                                         The field is so young that many researchers do not even agree on joint terminology! Given the field's infancy, in this blog post I hope to demistify some aspects of neuroengineering, which will hopefully allow you to more easily approach and understand the field.
                                        <br><br>

                                         In this blog post we are going to: define neuroengineering, and outline the field's divisions and goals. Sounds simple enough! 😃
                                        <br><br>
                                        <h3>Neuroengineering Definition</h3> 

                                         Since neuroengineering is such an interdisciplinary field, you should have a broad but working understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience">neuroscience</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering">electrical engineering</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a> before jumping in. A wikipedia refresher should do just fine! 😊
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b><u>Neuroengineering</u></b> is the study of appling engineering principles to one of following categories:
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>Reading then writing information out of the brain</li>
                                        <li>Interrogating biological principles of neuroscience systems</li>
                                        <li>Informing the algorithims used in hardware or software designs</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>
                                         Wooh that was a mouthful! Let's break it down.
                                        <br><br>
                                         <b>Reading then writing information out of the brain</b> is largely encapsulated in the field of neuroprosthetics. The devices created within the neuroprosthetics field go by many names such as brain machine interfaces (BMIs), neural prostheses, and brain computer interfaces (BCIs). These terms are mostly interchangeable.
                                        <br><br>
                                         Any hardware or software created to collect, compile, or decipher information from the brain would be a neuroengineering system that fits into this category. An awesome example is the <a href="file:///Users/saberatalukder/Documents/sabra/www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropixels">neuropixel probe</a> that can record from hundreds of neurons across multiple brain regions. The neuropixel is <a href="https://www.medgadget.com/2017/11/neuropixel-probe-monitors-brain-activity-across-multiple-brain-regions.html">pictured below</a>; the red arrows indicated the piece of the probe that is inserted into the brain 😱.

                                        <br>
                                         An important note: some devices that neither read nor write infomation out of the brain, <a href="http://www.medtronic.com/us-en/healthcare-professionals/therapies-procedures/neurological/deep-brain-stimulation/education-training/about-therapy-parkinsons.html">like deep brain stimulators (DBS) for Parkinson's Disease</a>, are sometimes referred to as neural prostheses. Keep in mind though, that these DBSs are not closed loop systems. Regardless, they are still incredibly effective at treating some diseases! 

                                        <br><br>
                                         <b><u>Interrogating biological principles of neuroscience systems</u></b> is largely dominated by the phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics">optogenetics</a>. Optogenetics is a method to induce or suppress neural activity by making neurons responsive to specific wavelengths of light. I swear this is not fiction, just incredible science! 🔬
                                        <br><br>

                                         <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/optogenetics/">Pictured below</a> is a mouse with an optical fiber implanted in its head to trigger optogenetically responsive neurons, or in other words what I imagine is one of the most famous mice in the world! 

                                        <img class="img-border img-left" src="./Sabera Talukder_files/mouseOpto.png" alt="" style="width:90%; height:100%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; margin-top: 3%; margin-bottom: 3%; border-radius:30px; border-width: thick">

                                        <br>
                                         Optogenetics, has been a revolutionary tool for the field of neuroengineering and neuroscience because it allows you to perturb neural systems in more causal manner than was ever possible before.
                                        Neuromodulation!
                                        <br><br>
                                        The third an final category is using the algorithms and principles that organize the nervous systems to create better hardware and software. This can largely contains neuromorphic computing which is the hardware component, and software component which is more realistic and competent artificial intelligence systems.
                                        <br><br>

                                        <h3>Goal's of Neuroengineering</h3>

                                        The goals of each of these subdivisions of neuroengineering are as follows:
                                        <br><br>
                                        The goals of 1 are possibly the most split in the field right now. And are to help people that are suffering from paralyasis, depression, parkinsons, etc. or to augment the human mind. *Cough* *Cough* if it was not obvious that I was talking about Elon I was. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        The goals of optogenetics, as well as the other ways to control neurons magnetogenetics anyone? are to be able to more causally perturb the neural system we are interested in in response to a certain stimulus or behavior. This has proved to be cruicial for many learning and memory experiments/
                                        The goals of calcium and voltage inicators are to be able to observe the system that is active during a particular stimulus or behavior, however with these methods you cannot perturb - only observe.
                                        <br><br>
                                        THe goals of borrowing neuroscience principles to inform hardware and software creations is to make more competent machines and algorithms that can perform more complex compuations and tasks. The fields of neuromorphic computing as well as artificial intelligence direly want to borrow from neuroscience so that we can eventually have consumer owned self-driving cars, or more complex robotic assistants.

                                        In future blog posts we will dive into each of these components more in depth, as well as walk through who the main players are in the fields both in academia as well as industry, as well as talk about what the most compelling technology is in each space.
